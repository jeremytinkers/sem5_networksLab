World Cup also has an official song, which have been performed by artists ranging from Shakira to Will Smith.[89][90] Other songs, such as “Nessun dorma”, performed by The Three Tenors at four World Cup concerts, have also become identified with the tournament.[91]

Forming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini published its first sticker album for the 1970 World Cup.[92] Since then, collecting and trading stickers and cards has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation.[93] FIFA has also licensed World Cup video games since 1986, with Electronic Arts the current license holder.[92]

Notes
 There was no third place match in 1930; the two losing semi-finalists are ranked according to their overall records in the tournament.[94]
 The final stage in 1950 was a round-robin group of four teams. Coincidentally, one of the last two matches pitted together the top two teams (and the only two who could win the title), and the other was between the bottom two teams. Uruguay v Brazil is often considered the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.[95][96]

(Uruguay, however, choose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, which are recognised by FIFA as World Championships, and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950).

With five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation t
